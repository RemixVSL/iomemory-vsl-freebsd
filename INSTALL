Installation
------------

To install the driver, a install-fio.sh is included.  If you rather, there are also manual install steps below.

Scripted Install
----------------

Run install-fio.sh and follow prompts.
$ ./install-fio.sh

Manual Install
--------------

1  Build the driver:
   In the driver directory:
   $ make
   This will produce a iomemory-vsl.ko file

2  Install the driver for autoload at boot
   From the driver directory:
   $ make install
   which copies the iomemory-vsl.ko file to /boot/modules

   Setup autoload and some options.  Add the following lines to
   /boot/loader.conf

   # set auto_attach to 0 to keep ioDrives from attaching the 
   # block device at boot
   # hw.fio.auto_attach="0"
   iomemory-vsl_load="YES"

3  Install utils from the bin directory
   The install script puts these in /usr/local/fusionio/bin

4  Update firmware if needed (see users guide) or load the driver
   $ kldload /boot/modules/iomemory-vsl.ko
