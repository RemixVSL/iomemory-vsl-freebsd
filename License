To the extent the Upgrade supersedes the original Product, you may no longer use such Product. This EULA applies to each Upgrade unless Fusion-io provides other terms with the Upgrade.  In case of a conflict between this EULA and such other terms, the other terms will prevail.

	10. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA.  Fusion-io may collect technical information relating to your use of Products.
