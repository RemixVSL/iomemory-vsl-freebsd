 * The constraints include not requiring recompilation for different versions
 * (debug/release, linux kernel versions &c.) for our proprietary portion of the
 * code.  Many internal Fusion-io structures include fusion_event_t stuctures as
 * a (non dynamically allocated) member.  We can either create and require using
 * dynamic allocators/deallocators and internally use pointers to structures, or
 * define a character structure large enough to accommodate the platform-specific
 * structure of any supported platforms.  The latter is ugly, but the one in use.
 *
 * A corollary to the above is that OS-specific header files should be included
 * in the porting layer's source files but _not_ in header files accessed by
 * non- porting layer include or source files.
